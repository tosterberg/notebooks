# Jupyter Notebooks

This repo is location for a variety of Jupyter Notebooks that I have completed for the Regis University M.S. Data Science. The program is broken up into three general tracks; business intelligence, data engineering and machine learning. Projects for courses that require Jupyter Notebooks are being persisted here over time.
